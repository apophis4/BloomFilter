# BloomFilter 

This is an implementation of Bloom Filter; a probablistic data structure.


How to use it:

1. Use `New(numElems, hashes)` function which takes two arguments.
2. numElems is probable total number of data set.
3. hashes is number of hash chain to be executed to insert or run tests.

Future implemention:

1. Provide a method to show % of error.
2. Murmur hash implementation
3. File based data structure.
